#  CxLos10-Team-Summary

## Description

The motivation behind constructing this application is to be able to neatly organize team members' info all in one document. This application is designed to solve issues with organization so that a manager can better keep track of their records. working on this project, I learned how to use the command line to prompt me to answer questions and then when I answer those questions, an html document is generated. I also learned how to implement testing into my project to test the functionality of my code.
